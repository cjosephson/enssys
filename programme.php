<h1>Technical Programme</h1>

ENSsys will be run in a hybrid format this year.
For this reason, we are operating on a slightly compressed schedule to maximize accessibility across time zones.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The ENSsys schedule is designed to co-ordinate where possible with the
<a href="https://sensys.acm.org/2021/program/">full SenSys schedule.</a></p>

<!-- I would just like to say that daylight savings is the worst and needs to *go away* -->

<h2>Full Programme</h2>

<h3>Demo Session &amp; Energy Harvesting Village</h3>
<p>This session will spotlight and showcase real-world, working energy-harvesting and energy-neutral systems.
To accommodate the hybrid nature of the event, we will kick off the session with
a series of spotlights of each of the demos. After the spotlights, attendees
can visit demos for more details via physical attendance at demo setups or
checking in to demo-specific video conferencing rooms.</p>
<p>The open demo session is timed to overlap with the coffee break for all
workshops, so demo presenters are encouraged to try to hang around near their
demos such that attendees of other SenSys workshops may have an opportunity to
visit your demo.</p>

<h3>Workshop Sessions</h3>
<p>For paper authors, ENSsys will adopt a discussion-oriented workshop format. Paper authors
will give a short overview of their ideas and prompts for discussion.</p>
<p>Given the challenges of hybrid-based discussions, the tentative plan is to
have two workshop breakouts, one for online presenters and attendees and one
for in-person attendees. We will update this section with a schedule and more
details once registration numbers are available and we have a better sense of
how many remote versus in-person attendees we will have.</p>
