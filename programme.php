<h1>Technical Programme</h1>

<p>
ENSsys will be run in a hybrid format this year.
For this reason, we are operating on a slightly compressed schedule to maximize accessibility across time zones.
</p>
<p>Remote attendees can <a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/98304600407">join via Zoom, here</a>.</p>
<p>For realtime chat with attendees or the ENSsys organizers, please use the <a href="https://sensys21-buildsys21.slack.com">SenSys / BuildSys 2021 Slack</a>.</p>
<p>For those unable to attend synchronously, we will be recording the opening
remarks and the demo spotlights.  To promote and ensure free and open
discussion, we <i>will not</i> be recording during the demo village or the
workshop sessions.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The ENSsys schedule is designed to co-ordinate where possible with the
<a href="https://sensys.acm.org/2021/program/">full SenSys schedule.</a></p>

<!-- I would just like to say that daylight savings is the worst and needs to *go away* -->

<h2>Full Programme</h2>

<h3>Demo Session &amp; Energy Harvesting Village</h3>
<p>This session will spotlight and showcase real-world, working energy-harvesting and energy-neutral systems.
To accommodate the hybrid nature of the event, we will kick off the session with
a series of spotlights of each of the demos. After the spotlights, attendees
can visit demos for more details via physical attendance at demo setups or
checking in to demo-specific video conferencing rooms.</p>
<p>The open demo session is timed to overlap with the coffee break for all
workshops, so demo presenters are encouraged to try to hang around near their
demos such that attendees of other SenSys workshops may have an opportunity to
visit your demo.</p>
<p>We have arranged the schedule of spotlights to optimize for hybrid
operation.  We will first &ldquo;tour&rdquo; the in-person demos, with on-site
personnel visiting each demo in turn and carrying a camera for remote
attendees.  We will then have the in-person folks come together for a viewing
of the remote demos.  During the village, we will have user-selectable
breakouts for the remote demos.  In-person demos will also have a breakout
room, where they can use the chat feature to interact with remote participants
(possibly video/audio as well, but we expect the crowded nature of the
in-person demo environment to make text chat the better option).</p>

<h3>Workshop Sessions</h3>
<p>For paper authors, ENSsys will adopt a discussion-oriented workshop format. Paper authors
will give a short overview of their ideas and prompts for discussion.</p>
<p>Given the challenges of hybrid-based discussions, the plan is to have two
workshop breakouts, one for online attendees and one for in-person attendees.</p>
