		print "Complementing the topics of SenSys 2021, this workshop will bring researchers together to explore the challenges, issues and opportunities in the research, design and engineering of energy-harvesting, energy-neutral, and intermittent sensing systems. ENSsys@SenSys will be a highly interactive workshop. First, we invite ''mini-tutorials'' and demos from established energy harvesting systems - we aim to open ENSsys with a showcase of existing work to set a baseline of what is possible today and spark ideas for what can be built in the future. Demos previously presented in other venues are explicitly welcome. For new work, we invite short pitches on technical issues in energy harvesting systems that remain underserved or more radical positions that invite rethinking of current system design. We will use these pitches to organise several smaller, highly interactive workgroups.";
